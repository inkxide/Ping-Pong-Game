Title: Ping Pong Game
||Description||
This program is a 2-player controlled classic Pong game and grants control over the slider to each player.
Player 1 controls the left-slider with "W" key to move up & "S" key for move down.
Player 2 controls the right-slider with "UP Arrow" key to move up & "DOWN Arrow" key to move down.
The speed of the ball gradually increases as players strike it back & forth till a either one of them misses and the opposing players earns a point.
To win both players must try to reach 7 points first by striking the ball to the other side.
